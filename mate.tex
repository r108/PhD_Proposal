\section{Maté: A Tiny Virtual Machine for Sensor Networks}
Maté is a byte code interpreter that runs as a single TinyOS component. It is implemented as a functional building block in the form of a Virtual Machine. Using isolation mechanisms and multiple execution contexts as a response to events, the VM architecture is designed to prevent system crashes caused by user applications. Maté provides high-level application interfaces allowing expressive yet concise programs to be composed of a set of simple and short instructions. In order to reprogram existing WSN deployments, Mate introduces program updates via self-propagating code capsules that are broadcast over the whole network. Nodes identify and install new code segments autonomously by maintaining version numbers.
