By allowing multiple heterogeneous network architectures to cohabit on a shared physical substrate, network virtualization provides flexibility, promotes diversity, and promises security and increased manageability. However, many technical issues stand in the way of its successful realization. This article investigates the past and the state of the art in network virtualization along with the future challenges that must be addressed to realize a viable network virtualization environment.}},

are likely to become a pervasive technology in the near
future due to the special characteristics of these devices
and to the great number of applications where it can be
applied. One of these applications is the critical
infrastructure protection (CIP). In fact, \\{WSANs\\} have
actually been identified as having the potential to become
an integral part of the CIP. However, in order to achieve
that goal, \\{WSANs\\} need to provide a set of features
which includes a robust QoS. Unfortunately QoS support
mechanisms in \\{WSANs\\} are still largely undeveloped.
This paper studies the state-of-the-art of QoS management
in \\{WSANs\\} by exploring existing proposals, challenges
and open issues in the field. Emphasis is put on QoS in the
context of \\{CIP\\} by focusing on the QoS requirements
and the needs of \\{CIP\\} applications. Existing middleware
and protocols are surveyed and the challenges and open
issues in the field are presented.},author = {Chen, Jaime and D\'{\i}az, Manuel and Llopis,
