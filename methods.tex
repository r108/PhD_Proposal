It is proposed to perform a rigorous study in the context of WSNs in order to meet the objectives outlined in section 2 using the following systematic approach:

\begin{itemize}
\item Conduct a comprehensive review of the relevant areas with emphasis on WSN virtualisation techniques (node level, network level) and  WSN programming.
\item Analyse the review of current literature/practice to gain insight and identify open research challenges.
\item Design and develop a new framework for WSN virtualisation by combining existing and novel techniques. 
\item Design and create appropriate experiments by setting up and configuring a virtualised WSN test bed. 
\item Evaluate the implemented framework against the desired characteristics specified in section 2.1.
\item Validate the scalability and performance of the approach and architecture against traditional approaches and analyse the implications of combining different virtualisation techniques within the various layers of the WSN infrastructure.
\item Identify the optimal configuration settings with the aim of achieving a balance between maximum resource utilization/performance and minimum power consumption/management complexity.
\end{itemize}
